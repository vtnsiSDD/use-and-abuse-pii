COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS
If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by the Site infringe your copyright, you or your agent may submit a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) notice by providing BREITBART with the following information in writing:
•	a physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive copyright that is allegedly infringed;
•	a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
•	a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site;
•	your name, address, telephone number, and email address and all other information reasonably sufficient to permit BREITBART to contact you;
•	a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
•	a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Any notification that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon BREITBART actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send to BREITBART a counter-notice. All notices and counter notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.
Notice of claims of copyright infringement can be made as follows:
Designated Agent: Webmaster
Address of Agent: 149 S. Barrington Ave., #735, Los Angeles, CA 90049
Email for notice: copyright@breitbart.com

If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your User Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the contact address for BREITBART set forth below:
•	your physical or electronic signature;
•	identification of the User Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the User Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
•	a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the User Content; and
•	your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in Los Angeles, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

Counter-notice of claims of copyright infringement can be sent to:
Designated Agent: Webmaster
Address of Agent: 149 S. Barrington Ave., #735, Los Angeles, CA 90049
Email for notice: copyright@breitbart.com
If a counter-notice is received, you agree that BREITBART may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at BREITBART’s sole discretion. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all the requirements of this section, your DMCA notice may not be valid.
