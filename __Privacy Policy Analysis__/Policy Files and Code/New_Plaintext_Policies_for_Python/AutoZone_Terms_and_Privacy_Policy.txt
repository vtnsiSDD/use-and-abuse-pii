Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to those third party websites that may be linked to our Website. This Privacy Policy does not govern the practices of third parties, including our partners, third party service providers, and/or advertisers even when those services are branded as, or provided on behalf of, AutoZone.

Submitting a Verifiable Request to AutoZone
As mentioned above, California residents have certain rights to access, delete, or otherwise control the use, collection, and/or disclosure of their information. AutoZone will respond to an individual’s "verifiable request" to exercise his or her rights under such laws – that is, where AutoZone has received a request purporting to be from a particular individual, and AutoZone has been able to verify the individual’s identity. The need to verify an individual’s identity is critical to protecting your information, and ensuring that your information is not shared with anyone pretending to be you or someone who is not authorized to act as your agent on your behalf. 
You may submit a verifiable request via our website or toll-free number, listed in the "How to Contact Us for CCPA Requests" section below, or as otherwise provided on our Website (if such means are available). AutoZone will ask you to provide information about yourself so that we can verify your identity as part of this process. This information may include your name, your address, your account information, and any other information deemed necessary by AutoZone to reasonably verify your identity, to ensure that your information is not shared with anyone impersonating you.
We may ask for additional information if we have difficulty confirming your identity. We will not share your information or honor other requests in those situations in which we are unable to confirm a request for your information is a "verifiable request."
Under California law a consumer can appoint an "authorized agent" to make certain verifiable requests upon their behalf, such as the right to know what information we collect about the consumer or to request deletion of the consumer’s information. Because the security and privacy of your information is paramount, we will ask that you identify and provide permission in writing for such persons to act as your authorized agent and exercise your applicable rights under California law in such situations. This may require us to contact you directly and alert you that an individual has claimed to be your agent and is attempting to access or delete your information. We will also independently verify your identity to ensure that an unauthorized person is not attempting to impersonate you and exercise your rights without authorization. We will not share your information or honor any other requests in those situations where you cannot or do not grant permission in writing for an identified authorized agent to act on your behalf, or where we cannot independently verify your identity.

USE OF COMMUNITY
The AutoZone.com® Community, including message boards, blogs, photo galleries and member profiles ("Community""), has been created to provide opportunities for members to share advice, experiences, ideas and questions with one another. The postings and comments expressed on any area of the Community are just opinions based on users' personal experience. You are responsible for your decisions and actions.

AutoZone reserves the right to make changes to these Community Terms and Conditions at any time. It is your responsibility to check this page for updates to the terms."
Getting Started
Welcome to AutoZone Community. If you are new to our Community or have a question, please review these simple guidelines to ensure you have a good experience:

Register for the site - if you have not created a MyZone® profile on our web sites ("Web Sites"), you will need to do that before you can post your own content to the Community. You do not have to register to view photo, video or Community content.

When you pick a user name, just make sure you do not use any brand or celebrity names (like "Mr. Nike," "NASCARman" or "Duralast Boy"). We reserve the right to reclaim usernames if, in our sole discretion, usernames contain vulgar references or references otherwise disallowed within the Community. We reserve the right to reclaim usernames that appear to impersonate or disparage businesses, individuals, or official Community moderators or administrators.

Be nice and respectful of others. Please do not let the anonymity of the web lure you into making snarky comments to others. If you would not say your comment to a real person standing next to you in the grocery store, please do not say it in our Community. The Community is provided as a matter of courtesy so you can share opinions and advice with others.
Community Etiquette
The Community's purpose is to discuss all things automotive.
•	Please keep the discussion relevant by staying on topic when posting in the Community. This service is provided to allow its users and our employees to share their knowledge and help one another. 
•	Please refrain from discussing personal matters, abusing any company or product, or, in general, from posting on topics unrelated to automotive issues and inquiries.
•	Please do not discuss pricing issues. This Community is not a transactional website. While we recognize that the issue of prices of products or services may come up, we do not want it to be the focus of the Community. We do not permit references to competitors or their prices. If you wish to refer to an AutoZone price, then please recognize that prices change over time. A price that is current today may not be correct tomorrow. Please check the current prices before relying on any information posted in the Community.
•	Please be courteous and respectful to everyone engaging in the Community. Your opinions are always welcome, but personal attacks and harassment ("flaming") in the Community is not acceptable. 
•	The Community is intended for use by individuals 13 years of age or older. The Community is not directed for use by children under the age of 13. Users under the age of 13 should obtain the assistance of a parent or guardian to use this site. AutoZone does not knowingly collect information from children online. AutoZone values our relationship with our customers and is committed to responsible information-handling practices.

As part of our commitment to customer service, AutoZone strives to make you feel safe and comfortable doing business with us. Here are some guidelines AutoZone follows regarding our collection and use of your information – including your Personal Information – and our efforts to keep your Personal Information private. AutoZone reserves the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time in our sole discretion.

This Privacy Statement informs you about how we collect, use, protect, and disclose your information when you visit and shop at the AutoZone family of websites at www.autozone.com, www.autozonepro.com, www.duralastparts.com, (“Websites”), via the AutoZone mobile app or the AutoZone Pro mobile app (“Apps”), at our AutoZone retail stores across the United States (“Stores”), or when you use any of the other services that we may make available to you (collectively, “Services”). This Privacy Statement also informs you about certain choices and rights you have associated with your information, and how you can manage the privacy of your Personal Information. Please note that this Privacy Statement does not govern the practices of third parties, including our partners, third party service providers, and/or advertisers, even when those services are branded as, or provided on behalf of, AutoZone. Information collected from you by others, such as third-party websites that you access through links on the Website, are governed by those entities’ privacy policies. Please read such third party’s privacy policies carefully. 
The data collection and use practices for the AutoZone Websites are largely similar to how AutoZone collects customer information when you visit the Apps or our Store locations. However, there may be some differences between how the App collects and uses your information, and how information is collected and used by the Websites or in Stores. These differences will be identified throughout this policy.
Information We Collect
AutoZone may collect certain personal information about you in order to provide and improve our Services to you. The following information describes the categories of personal information AutoZone may have collected in the preceding twelve months and the categories of sources from which that information may have been collected.

“Personal Information” means information about a particular individual or household that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, could be reasonably linked with, or could be used to directly or indirectly identify that person or household (or from those and other information either in our possession or likely to come into our possession). It may also include other information that may be associated with your Personal Information, such as Generic Information (defined below), location, preferences or interests, if that information can be used to identify you, your household, or your device.

Business Information (for the AutoZone Pro Website & AutoZone Pro Mobile App): AutoZone Pro, its Website, App, and Services are business-to-business services provided to our commercial customers to help them meet their business needs. As such, much of the information that we collect from our AutoZone Pro customers relate to their business, including their business’ name, address, zip code, telephone number, email address, financial account information to facilitate transactions with AutoZone Pro, vehicle information, and other information related to their business. Additionally, AutoZone Pro may need to collect information related to an individual’s role within the company to fulfill an order or inquiry with AutoZone Pro, such as the individual’s name, title, location, telephone number, email address, other contact information, information related to an “AutoZone Commercial” Account with the Website, and other information. We will also collect your email address and a password that you choose when you request an “AutoZone Commercial” account with the Websites.
Personal Information: AutoZone may collect the following “Personal Information” about you when you use our Services: your name, address, zip code, telephone number, email address, gender, age, date of birth, and information about your automobile (such as your Vehicle Identification Number (“VIN”) and year). AutoZone may also collect your credit card information and billing address when you provide AutoZone with such information, such as when you buy products in our Stores and on our Website; however your payment card information is passed securely to our payment card processor and is not stored by AutoZone. We will also collect your email address and a password that you choose when you create a personal “MyZone Account” with the Websites or “My Account” account within the Apps. We may also collect location-related information and information related to your purchase and product interest history.
Generic Information: Generic Information may include data that relates to Website pages viewed and visit duration, App usage, device information, your IP address information, your browser or operating system information, or other information that relates to your interaction with our Websites or Apps. In some situations, Generic Information may be used or combined in a way that it identifies you, your company, or your position within your company. In those situations, such information will be treated like Business Information or Personal Information, as applicable.
Cookies & Tracking Data: The Websites and Apps may use third party products and services to gather anonymous traffic statistics using cookies and web beacons. A cookie is a small piece of information stored on your device that helps the Websites, Apps and multiple servers recognize you. AutoZone and its third-party service providers may also use other tracking technologies such as pixels, or transparent GIF files, for app and web site management and user tracking.
Some of the cookies we use are “strictly necessary” for the functionality of our Websites and Apps. Others improve the functionality of our Websites and Apps but are not strictly necessary. Some cookies help improve the performance of our Websites and Apps (such as by gathering analytic data), while others help provide targeted services to you (like ads that you may be interested in).

Examples of cookies we use include:
•	Session Cookies. We use Session Cookies to operate our Services. Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted once you close your Internet browser.
•	Preference Cookies. We use Preference Cookies to remember your preferences and various settings. Preference cookies are first party cookies that remain on your computer or device until you delete them, or they are otherwise removed upon expiration. 
•	Third Party Cookies. AutoZone permits third-party service providers, advertisers and other companies to use cookies or other similar technologies on our Website. These companies may collect your information, track your behavior on our Website or Apps, and gather information about your use of our Apps, Websites, and other online services over time and across different services. Additionally, some companies may use information collected to deliver targeted ads on behalf of us or other companies, including on other apps, websites, or online services. We are not responsible for the functioning of cookies and other technologies used and placed by third parties on your device.
•	Pixel Tags, Web Beacons, and Transparent GIFs. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on app or website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages.
•	Other Technologies. We collect many different types of information from other technologies to improve the quality of our Website and the services we provide. For example, we may collect Usage Data and other information about the device you use to access our Apps and Websites, your operating system and/or mobile device type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. We may record the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.

These third-party companies may use cookies and other technologies to recognize your browser to collect and record information about your web surfing activity including your activities on the Websites and Apps. In addition to adjusting your browser or device’s cookie settings, you can also opt-out of having non-Personal Information or cookies used to target ads to you by the party service providers.

Personal Information Collected over the Last 12 Months
AutoZone has not collected any other types of Personal Information from our customers and visitors over the last 12 months.

How We Collect Your Information
AutoZone collects your information in a few ways: there is information that you give us, information we obtain through your use of our Services – including our Websites and Apps – and information we obtain from third parties.
I. Information You Give Us: We collect information that you decide to share with us. At times, we may require you to provide certain information – including Personal Information – in order to use certain parts of our Apps and Websites, fulfill your requests with us, or provide you with certain Services. For instance, we will require you to provide your name, address, and payment card information when you make a purchase through our Apps and Websites. We may require you to provide your name, email address or other contact information when you contact us with a question or comment. If you establish a “MyZone” or “AutoZone Rewards” account with us, we may require you to provide your name, an email address and telephone number, and create a password to create your account. We will require you to provide your email address if you choose to sign up for our Duralast mailing list. AutoZone Pro will chiefly collect Business Information to fulfill orders between AutoZone Pro and its commercial customers.

II. Information We Obtain When You Use Our Services: We collect certain information from you through your use of our Services, such as App and Website usage data and other Generic information. For instance, in using our Websites and Apps, we may collect information about the device you use to log into, access, and use the Websites and Apps. We may collect other Generic Information in relation to how you use our Websites, Apps, or other Services (for example, aggregate metrics on how often certain pages on our Websites or Apps are accessed and viewed).
•	Location Information: We may ask you to provide your location information when you use our Apps or Websites, to provide store locations in proximity as well as certain App features and Services. You may choose to disable location tracking; however, certain functions of the Websites and Apps not work properly if you do not share your location.
•	Aggregate Data: We may use other Generic information such as aggregate data in relation to how you use our Websites, Apps, or other Services.
•	Other: We collect generic network information to assure the proper optimization for Website and App functionality.

•	Phone and Contacts: The Apps may request access to your device’s contacts. It may also need to access your device’s phone functions to directly call phone numbers and read phone status and identity.

III. Information We Obtain from Other Sources / Third Parties: We may also obtain information about you from third parties who help us provide our Services to you. For example, we may obtain information about your order or product return from our order fulfillment and delivery partners. We may also obtain some information from our marketing partners in order to inform you about products that we think you might be interested in. Finally, we may obtain information, including Generic Information and Business Information, that does not identify you directly, but which is used in a way that may transform the information into Personal Information. For instance, AutoZone may receive warranty or product recall information from a part manufacturer or distributor related to a product that you purchased from us. We may combine that general information with your information in our national warranty database or other systems to provide related services to you.

As mentioned above, California residents have certain rights to access, delete, or otherwise control the use, collection, and/or disclosure of their information. AutoZone will respond to an individual’s “verifiable request” to exercise his or her rights under such laws – that is, where AutoZone has received a request purporting to be from a particular individual, and AutoZone has been able to verify the individual’s identity. The need to verify an individual’s identity is critical to protecting your information and ensuring that your information is not shared with anyone pretending to be you or someone who is not authorized to act as your agent on your behalf. 

You may submit a verifiable request via our website or toll-free number listed in the “How to Contact Us for CCPA Requests” section below or as otherwise provided on our Websites and Apps (if such means are available). AutoZone will ask you to provide information about yourself so that we can verify your identity as part of this process.

Once we have verified your identity, we will work to fulfill your request in a timely manner. Please note there may be some situations in which we are unable to fulfill your request, such as if we cannot find any information about you within your systems. Additionally, we may not be able to honor a deletion request in some situations, such as if your information is necessary to fulfill your order with us or meet a legal obligation.

We may ask for additional information if we have difficulty confirming your identity. We will not share your information or honor other requests in those situations in which we are unable to verify your identity.

Under California law a consumer can appoint an “authorized agent” to make certain verifiable requests upon their behalf, such as the right to know what information we collect about the consumer or to request deletion of the consumer’s information. Because the security and privacy of your information is paramount, we will ask that you identify and provide permission in writing for such persons to act as your authorized agent and exercise your applicable rights under California law in such situations.

We will also independently verify your identity to ensure that an unauthorized person is not attempting to impersonate you and exercise your rights without authorization. We will not share your information or honor any other requests in those situations where you cannot or do not grant permission in writing for an identified authorized agent to act on your behalf, or where we cannot independently verify your identity.

You must drain all fluids, if any, from the product before returning it.* It’s recommended that you take the credit card used to purchase the product so the store can credit your card for the price of the product. If you do not have the credit card, or you purchased with PayPal or another digital payment method, simply present your receipt and the product, and the store will reimburse your account.

All returns to an AutoZone store are subject to the Store Return Policy, and not all products are eligible for returns. For instance, all sales of customized items are final, and not eligible for returns. 
Product Return by Mail
To return a product AutoZone shipped to you by mail, fill out the Return Form (found in Section B of your Shipping Invoice) and include it with the product in its original packaging and/or box. Before packing be sure to first drain all fluids, if any, from the product.*

You will be reimbursed for shipping costs only if AutoZone made a shipping error or if the product was defective when shipped by AutoZone. Please complete the "Return Reasons Code" section of this form and refer to the Customer Care Center number provided to make shipping arrangements.

If you are shipping from a location within the United States, and if either (i) AutoZone made a shipping error or (ii) the product was defective when shipped from AutoZone's Fulfillment Center, AutoZone will provide you with a prepaid return shipping label. Simply place the shipping label on the outside of the box and drop off the package at a shipping facility of your choice.

Core Return Policy
What is a core?

When a vehicle is repaired, the old or failed part that was replaced is called a core. These cores are then remanufactured (recycled) by companies to original equipment specifications. Remanufacturing is the process of taking used parts, completely disassembling and thoroughly cleaning them, replacing the faulty and/or worn components with original quality components, and restoring them to their original function. The testing and procedures are the same as the original equipment manufacturers.

Your shipment or other return of any core or other product to AutoZone or AutoZone.com is considered a transfer of ownership, and AutoZone will be unable to return the core or other product to you. 
Core Return to an AutoZone store
To return a core to an AutoZone store, simply take the product, in its original packaging and/or box, to the store of your choice along with your receipt. You must drain all fluids, if any, from the product before returning it.*

AutoZone recommends that you take the credit card used to purchase the new product so the store can credit your card for the value of the core, assuming the core passes inspection. If you do not have the credit card, or you purchased the product with PayPal or another payment method, simply present your receipt, and upon the core passing the inspection, the store will reimburse your account for the value of the returned core.

If the core does not pass inspection, you will not be reimbursed for it and the core will be returned to you. 
Core Return by Mail
To return a core to AutoZone by mail, first drain all fluids, if any, from the product.* Then fill out the Return Form (found in Section B of your Shipping Invoice) and include it along with the core in the original packaging and/or box in which it was received.

To mail the core, simply place the return shipping label on the outside of the box and drop off the package at a shipping facility of your choice. You are responsible for verifying and complying with proper shipping requirements of your selected carrier.

Please note when returning a core, you will not be reimbursed for shipping costs incurred in shipping the core to AutoZone.

Assuming the core passes inspection, the credit card you used to purchase the new product will be credited in the amount of the core's value as indicated by the inspection. If you do not have the credit card, or you purchased with PayPal or another payment method, simply enclose a copy of your receipt and the product, and AutoZone will credit your account in the amount of the value of the core. If the core does not pass inspection, you will not be reimbursed for it.

*Please recycle or properly dispose of fluids drained from the returned part. The parts must be free of all flammable and hazardous fluids before shipment. Many AutoZone stores have a free recycling program. If you do not live near an AutoZone store, or the AutoZone in your area does not have a recycling program, contact your local recycling agency for instructions on proper disposal.

AutoZone also requires its vendors to employ workers in compliance with local labor laws, including but not limited to legal employment age regulations. In no case does AutoZone knowingly procure goods or services from factories employing workers under the legal minimum age. AutoZone encourages vendors to be proactive in contributing to the continued education and betterment of their employees. AutoZone requires its vendors to provide products that have not been produced using forced labor. Forced labor includes, but is not limited to, all forms of slavery or practices similar to slavery, bonded labor, involuntary labor resulting from trafficking, and labor subject to arbitrary abuse.

AutoZone expects its supply chain network to be security compliant. Our vendors are expected to meet or exceed industry standards and comply with policies related to container security, access and loading processes, seal management, and human resources practices, and such other security standards as AutoZone may direct from time to time. AutoZone does not allow illegal payments to any person, organization, or government. Vendors must not give funds, property, services or labor, directly or indirectly, to anyone in order to obtain business or any special or unusual treatment for AutoZone. This includes vendors and their agents, representatives, employees, officers and directors, and U.S. or foreign officials or agents.

All AutoZone Vendors: AutoZone requires a Vendor Agreement for all of its vendors—foreign and domestic. This agreement states that the vendor will indemnify AutoZone if it does not comply fully with all applicable local and international laws and regulations.

AutoZone Distribution Centers: AutoZone expects all loads coming into its distribution centers to be sealed by the vendors according to AutoZone’s security procedures. AutoZone has policies and procedures in place for the inspection of any loads arriving with seal discrepancies. Internally, AutoZone inspects, secures, and seals all of its trailers between its distribution centers, vendors, stores and other third parties.
