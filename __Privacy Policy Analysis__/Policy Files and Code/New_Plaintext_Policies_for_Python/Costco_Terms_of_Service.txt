The Site Terms apply exclusively to your access to, and use of, the Sites and do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with Costco for products, services, or otherwise.

Costco has adopted a Privacy Policy that you should refer to in order to fully understand how we use and collect information. To learn about Costco's privacy practices, please refer to the Privacy Policy section of the Sites.

B. Modification of Site Terms
Costco reserves the right to modify these Site Terms in our sole discretion from time to time and only Costco has the right to do so. If the Site Terms are changed, we will post the new terms on the Sites and note the date they were last updated. Any changes or modification will be effective upon posting of the Site Terms as revised, and your use of the Sites following the posting will constitute your acceptance of the new Site Terms.

C. United States Usage
The Site is operated by a U.S. entity and is governed by the state and federal laws of the United States. The laws of your jurisdiction may be more or less strict than the laws that apply to the Sites. If you access the Sites from outside the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction.

You may not use the Sites or Costco’s services if you are the subject of U.S. sanctions or of sanctions consistent with U.S. law imposed by the government of the country where you are accessing the Sites or using Costco’s services. You are responsible for compliance with all U.S. or other export and re-export restrictions that may apply to goods, software, technology and services.

D. License and Site Access
Costco grants you a limited license to make personal use only of the Sites. Such grant does not include, without limitation: (a) any resale or commercial use of the Sites or any Site Materials (defined below); (b) modification, adaptation, translation, reverse engineering, decompilation, disassembly or conversion into human readable form any of the Site Materials not intended to be so read, including use of or directly viewing the underlying HTML or other code from the Sites except as interpreted and displayed in a web browser; (c) copying, imitating, mirroring, reproducing, distributing, publishing, downloading, displaying, performing, posting or transmitting any Site Materials (including any Costco trademarks) in any form or by any means, including, but not limited to, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording or otherwise; (d) the collection and use of any product listings or descriptions; (e) making derivative uses of the Sites and any Site Materials; or (f) use of any data mining, bots, spiders, automated tools or similar data gathering and extraction methods, directly or indirectly, on the Site Materials or to collect any information from the Sites or any other user of the Sites. Except as noted above, you are not conveyed any right or license by implication, estoppel, or otherwise in or under a patent, trademark, copyright, or proprietary right of Costco or any third party. You may not use any meta tags or any other “hidden text” utilizing Costco's name, trademark, or product name without our express written consent. “Site Materials” means all materials on the Sites, including, without limitation, trademarks (as specifically defined in these Site Terms), design, product description, HTML text, graphics, other files, photographs, codes, software layout, design forms and the selection and arrangement thereof.

We may terminate this license and your use of or access to the Sites if you make or permit any unauthorized use of the Sites. Such actions by you may violate applicable law including, without limitation, copyright laws, trademark laws (including trade dress), and communications regulations and statutes. We reserve the right to have all violators prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

E. Payment Terms
1. Costco Shop Card
Costco Shop Cards (formerly known as “Costco Cash Cards”), whether physical or electronic, are issued by Costco Wholesale Corporation. Use of the card constitutes acceptance of the following terms:

• the card may be used only for making purchases of merchandise or gasoline at any Costco location in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada, or on Costco.com and Costco.ca;
• neither Costco Wholesale Corporation nor its affiliates are responsible for use of the card without your permission; and
• balances cannot be applied as payments to any account or redeemed for cash, except as required by law.
For balance inquiry for a Costco Shop Card, visit costco.com.

2. Mobile Payments
If you use a Costco Pay fob and link your credit card or other accepted payment method to it, you may utilize the Costco Pay fob to facilitate transactions and make payments at Costco fuel stations. When you scan your Costco Pay fob at a Costco fuel station, your default payment method will be charged. You can select your default payment method during set-up of your Costco Pay fob. Fobs are the property of Costco and must be returned upon request.

As used in these Site Terms, payments through the Costco Pay fob are referred to as “Mobile Payments”. Mobile Payments are processed by third parties that will receive your payment information. To keep your financial data secure, we do not store full credit card information.

Costco reserves the right at any time to discontinue or suspend Mobile Payments or where they are accepted.

F. Changes, Misprints, Errors and Cancellations
Subject to applicable law, we: (a) reserve the right to change the goods and services advertised or offered for sale through the Sites, the prices or specifications of such goods and services, and any promotional offers and any other Site Materials at any time and from time to time without any notice or liability to you or any other person; (b) cannot guarantee that goods or services advertised or offered for sale on the Sites will be available when ordered or thereafter; (c) reserve the right to limit quantities sold or made available for sale; (d) do not warrant that the Site Materials (including without limitation product descriptions or photographs) are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free; and (e) reserve the right to cancel, to terminate or not to process orders (including accepted orders) where the price or other material information on the Sites is inaccurate or when we recognize abuse of our policies. If we do not process an order for such reason, we will advise you that the order has been cancelled and will either not charge you or will apply credit to the payment type used in the order. Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusions and disclaimers of certain implied warranties, so some of the provisions of this section may not apply to you.

Where required by law, taxes applicable to merchandise you are purchasing will be added to your order. In the rare event the amount of tax charged on your order is not correct, you may request a refund in accordance with the state laws applicable to your purchase.
G. Passwords and Security
If you use a password to access the Sites or any portion of it, then you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and for restricting access to the device you use to access the Sites, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur on your account or with your password. In the event that the confidentiality of your account or password is compromised in any manner, you will notify Costco immediately. Costco reserves the right to take any and all action, as it deems necessary or reasonable to maintain the security of the Sites and your account, including without limitation, terminating your account, changing your password or requesting information to authorize transactions on your account. While Costco takes prudent steps to protect your account and the Sites, it cannot protect your information outside of the Sites. For example, when Costco communicates with you via unencrypted email from time to time, the communication is not secure, is not stored securely, and the information contained may be viewed by others. You acknowledge that by requesting information by email, you agree that we may transmit it to you from time to time and store it in an unencrypted form and manner. Costco may rely on the authority of anyone accessing your account or using your password and in no event will Costco be held liable to you for any liabilities or damage resulting from or arising out of (i) any action or inaction of Costco under this provision; (ii) any compromise of the confidentiality of your account or password; and (iii) any unauthorized access to your account or use of your password.

Forward-looking statements include all passages containing verbs such as "aims," "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "intends," "plans," "predicts," "projects," or "targets" or nouns corresponding to such verbs. Forward-looking statements also include statements or other passages primarily relevant to expected future events or that can only be evaluated by events that will occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management at the time the statements are made and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to be materially different from those anticipated in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could potentially affect our results is contained in the reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to any risk factors we identify in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or current Reports on Form 8K. Forward-looking or other statements speak only as to the date they were released. Costco undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking or other statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date the statements were made.
