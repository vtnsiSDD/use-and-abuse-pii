Share	Tweet

Note: If you’re under 18, please make sure that your parent or guardian has read and agreed to these terms before you complete the registration process.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc. (“PETA” or “we”), operates this site and provides the social networking tools and services that allow individual users to create customized online personal profiles. The services offered by PETA include access to any PETA-branded URL (the “PETA Website”) and other features (e.g., music and video embedded players) made available by PETA from time to time, the opportunity for users to create and upload their own content on the PETA Website, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by PETA in connection with this site (collectively, the “PETA Services”). The PETA Services are hosted in the U.S.

This Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of the PETA Services. By using the PETA Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a “Visitor” (which means that you simply browse the PETA Website, including through a mobile device, or otherwise use the PETA Services without being registered) or you are a “Member” (which means that you have created an account or are otherwise registered with PETA). The term “User” refers to a Visitor or a Member. You are only authorized to use the PETA Services (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) if you agree to abide by all applicable laws and the terms of this Agreement. Please read this Agreement carefully. If you do not agree to be bound by it or with any of the legal provisions applicable to it and to follow all applicable laws, you should leave the PETA Website and discontinue use of the PETA Services immediately. If you wish to become a Member, communicate with other Members, and/or make use of the PETA Services, you must read this Agreement and indicate your acceptance during the registration process.

This Agreement includes PETA’s policy for acceptable use of the PETA Services and Content (as defined in Section 6.1 below) posted on or through the PETA Services as well as your rights, obligations, and restrictions regarding your use of the PETA Services and Content posted on or through the PETA Services. In order to participate in certain PETA Services, you may be notified that you are required to download software or content and/or agree to additional terms and conditions from PETA. Unless otherwise provided by the additional terms and conditions applicable to the PETA Services in which you choose to participate, those additional terms are hereby incorporated into this Agreement.

PETA may modify this Agreement from time to time, and such modification shall be effective upon posting by PETA on the PETA Website. Your continued use of the PETA Services after PETA posts a revised Agreement signifies your acceptance of the revised Agreement. It is therefore important that you review this Agreement regularly to ensure that you are updated as to any changes.

Please choose carefully the information that you post on or through the PETA Services and that you provide to other Users. Your PETA profile may not include any form of Prohibited Content, as outlined in Section 8 below. Despite this prohibition, information, materials, products, or services provided by other PETA Members (for instance, in their profiles) may, in whole or in part, be unauthorized, impermissible, or otherwise violate this Agreement, and PETA assumes no responsibility or liability for this material. If you become aware of misuse of the PETA Services by any person, please click on the “Contact PETA” or the “Report Abuse” link at the bottom of the PETA Website pages.

1. General. PETA has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with this site. PETA may investigate any apparent or reported violations of its policies and take any action that it, in its sole and absolute discretion, deems appropriate, including but not limited to issuing warnings; rejection of, refusal to post, or removal of any materials on the site; and/or denial, restriction, suspension, or termination of your access to any or all part(s) of the PETA Services at any time. PETA expressly reserves the right to remove, screen, or edit any content that PETA deems, in its sole and absolute discretion, to violate this Agreement or any applicable law or to be otherwise objectionable. If we receive complaints that upon investigation show that you have repeatedly violated third-party copyright, PETA may permanently suspend your registration for and use of the PETA Services. PETA may take any or all of the actions above at any time, with or without prior notice or explanation, and without liability.

2. Eligibility. Use of the PETA Services and registration to be a Member for the PETA Services (“Membership”) is void where prohibited. By using the PETA Services, you represent and warrant that (a) all registration information that you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; (c) you are 13 years of age or older; and (d) your use of the PETA Services does not violate any applicable law or regulation. Your profile may be deleted and your Membership may be terminated without warning if we believe that you are under 13 years of age, if we believe that you are under 18 years of age and you represent yourself as 18 or older, or if we believe that you are over 18 years of age and represent yourself as under 18.

3. Term. This Agreement and any posted revision to this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use the PETA Services or are a Member. You may terminate your Membership at any time, for any reason, by e-mailing Newsmanager@peta.org. PETA may terminate your Membership at any time for any or no reason, with or without prior notice or explanation, and without liability. Even after Membership is terminated, this Agreement, including Sections 5 to 17, will remain in effect.

4. Password. When you sign up to become a Member, you will also be asked to choose a password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You agree not to use the account, username, or password of another Member at any time or to disclose your password to any third party. You agree to notify PETA immediately if you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or access to your password. You are solely responsible for any and all use of your account.

5. Use by Members. The PETA Services are for the personal use of Members only. The Services may only be used for commercial endeavors if such endeavors are specifically endorsed or authorized by PETA. PETA reserves the right to remove commercial content in its sole discretion. Illegal and/or unauthorized use of the PETA Services, including collecting usernames, user ID numbers, and/or e-mail addresses of Members by electronic or other means for the purpose of sending unsolicited e-mail or unauthorized framing of or linking to the PETA Website, or employing third-party promotional sites or software to promote profiles for money, is prohibited. Commercial advertisements, affiliated business links, and other forms of unauthorized solicitation may be removed from Member profiles without notice or explanation and may result in termination of Membership privileges. PETA reserves the right to take appropriate legal action for any illegal or unauthorized use of the PETA Services.

6. Proprietary Rights in Content on the PETA Website

6.1 PETA does not claim any ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, software scripts and applications, or any other materials (collectively, “Content”) that you post on or through the PETA Services. After posting your Content to the PETA Services, you continue to retain any such rights that you may have in your Content, subject to the limited license herein.

6.2 The license that you grant to PETA is non-exclusive (meaning that you are free to license your Content to anyone else in addition to PETA); fully paid and royalty-free (meaning that PETA is not required to pay you for the use on the PETA Services of the Content that you post); sublicensable; and worldwide (because the Internet and the PETA Services are global in reach).

6.4 The PETA Services contain Content of PETA (“PETA Content”). PETA Content is protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other laws, and PETA owns and retains all rights in the PETA Content and the PETA Services.

7.1 PETA may reject, refuse to post, or delete any Content for any or no reason, including Content that in the sole judgment of PETA violates this Agreement or which may be offensive or illegal, violate the rights of any person or entity, or harm or threaten the safety of any person or entity. PETA assumes no responsibility for monitoring the PETA Services for inappropriate Content or conduct. If at any time PETA chooses, in its sole discretion, to monitor the PETA Services, PETA nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the Content, no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Content, and no responsibility for the conduct of the User submitting any such Content.

7.2 You are solely responsible for the Content that you post on or through any of the PETA Services, any material or information that you transmit to other Members, and your interactions with other Users.

8. Content/Activity Prohibited. PETA prohibits the use of the PETA Services to post or transmit Content that is illegal or depicts illegal activity. The following are examples of the kind of Content that is illegal or prohibited to post on or through the PETA Services. PETA reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate action against anyone who, in PETA’s sole and absolute discretion, violates this provision, including, without limitation, removing the offending Content from the PETA Website, terminating the Membership of such violators, and/or reporting violators to law enforcement authorities. Prohibited Content includes, but is not limited to, Content that in the sole and absolute discretion of PETA:

If you breach this Agreement and send unsolicited bulk e-mail, instant messages, or other unauthorized commercial communications of any kind through the PETA Services, you acknowledge that you will have caused substantial harm to PETA but that the amount of such harm would be extremely difficult to ascertain.

If you believe that your work has been copied and posted on or through the PETA Services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please send PETA’s Copyright Agent a notification of claimed infringement with all the following information (see 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3) for further detail): (a) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; (b) identification of the claimed infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material on the PETA Services (providing the URL(s) of the claimed infringing material will in most cases satisfy this requirement); (c) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an e-mail address; (d) a statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; (e) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf; and (f) your physical or electronic signature.

We may provide your notice (including any contact details displayed in the complaint) to the poster of the work. PETA accommodates tools and technologies that help facilitate copyright owners’ control over their copyrighted works.

9.2. Counter-Notification. If you believe that Content you posted on or through the PETA Services and that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have authorization from the copyright owner or their agent or pursuant to the law to post such Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to PETA’s Copyright Agent at the address above: (a) identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled (providing the original URL(s) of the material satisfies this requirement); (b) your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and the username of your PETA account; (c) a statement that, under penalty of perjury, you have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the material; (d) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, if your address is outside the U.S.), and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement or their agent; and (e) your physical or electronic signature.

If a counter-notice is received by PETA’s Copyright Agent, PETA may send a copy of it to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the User who originally posted the material, the removed Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at PETA’s sole and absolute discretion.
