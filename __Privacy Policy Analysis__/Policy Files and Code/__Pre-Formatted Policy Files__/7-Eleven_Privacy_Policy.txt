This Privacy Policy explains how 7-Eleven, Inc., (7-Eleven,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you access or use our websites, located at https://www.7-eleven.com (the “Site” or “Sites”), mobile application(s) (“Apps”), and other online products and services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”), participate in the 7Rewards loyalty program described at https://www.7-eleven.com/7rewards (the “Program”), shop in our stores, contact our customer service team, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other data gathered or used by 7-Eleven including data collected through websites that do not link to this Privacy Policy.


We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases (for example if we plan to use your information in a way that materially differs from this Privacy Policy), we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of any changes to this policy means you accept such changes.
1. Information Collection:

When you use the Services or visit our stores, we collect the following types of information from and about you. Some of this information may be considered “Personal Information,” meaning it reasonably identifies you or your device or it is reasonably associated with you. Personal information does not include transactional data related to purchases at 7-Eleven stores, unless we combine such transaction data with your Personal Information, which we may do. We also collect, use, and disclose aggregated or deidentified data that does not identify you or your device.


Information You Provide to Us:


When you open an account with us through the Services or provide us with information directly during an in-store visit (“Account”), we may ask you to provide us with Identifiers such as your name, telephone number, email address, physical address, birth date, and any other information you may provide. We may also collect Identifiers when you participate in any interactive features of the Services (like send a message through the Services), fill out a form, participate in a contest or promotion, make a purchase, apply for a job, communicate with us via third party social media sites, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. 


We may collect Demographic Information through when you submit information such as age and gender, as well as interests if you register for an Account.


We may collect Commercial Information such as your purchase history, including records of products you have purchased, returned or are considering purchasing from us.


We may collect Professional or Employment-related and Education Information when you submit an application, resume or C.V. To process your application for a position, we may also obtain information about you from outside sources. Where you submit information on behalf of another person, you confirm that you have made that person aware of how we may collect, use and disclose their information, the reason you have provided it, how they can contact us, the terms of this Privacy Policy and that they have consented to such collection, use and disclosure.


We may collect Payment Information (Categories of Information in California Civil Code 1798.80) when you submit credit card or other payment or billing information in connection with the purchase or a good or service.


Finally, we may collect Other Content and Information you Share through the Services or Program when you submit information or content, such as by commenting on a blog or participating in online forums or communities, or when you otherwise interact with us.


Information Collected Automatically Through the Services and Visits to Our Stores:


When you access or use our Services or transact business with us, we automatically collect information about you, including:


Identifiers, such as your IP address, Internet service provider (ISP), mobile advertising ID, media access control (MAC) address, the type of mobile device you use, the temporary or persistent unique device identifiers (sometimes called UDID), and identifiers associated with browser cookies, web beacons and similar technologies we deploy on our Services;


Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information: We may collect information about the devices and computers you use to access our Services such as browser type, language, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, and hyperlinks clicked. When you visit our Services, we collect usage information sent to us by your computer, mobile, or other access device that tells us how you are using the Services and other information about your internet activity (“usage information”).


Commercial Information such as your purchase history, including records of products you have purchased, returned or are considering purchasing from us, including information collected through the Apps, such as transactional information, when you make a purchase or return, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details, purchase price, and date and location of the transaction.


Geolocation Information. We may derive the approximate location of your device from your IP address. In accordance with your device permissions, we may also collect information about the precise location of your device, such as when you search for a store. We may combine this information with other location-based information, such as your IP address and billing or postal code, for example, to give you information about stores near you and to provide you with other services. You have the ability to stop the collection of precise location information at any time (see “Your Choices” below for details).


Information Collected From Other Sources:


We may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, we may collect information about you from third parties, including but not limited to identity verification services, credit bureaus, mailing list providers, and publicly available sources. We may also obtain information about you from other sources, including but not limited to joint marketing partners, social media platforms, people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected to on social media platforms, and other third parties. For example, if you connect your social media account to your Account, or create or log into your Account through a social media site, certain information from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include information that is part of your profile or your friends’ profiles. In addition, we may supplement the information that you provide us and/or the information we collect from you with demographic, social, and other information about you that we receive from other sources. Once we combine information from other sources with your information collected pursuant to this policy, we apply this policy to the combined information as long as it is combined.


Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technology:


We (and our third-party partners and service providers) use different technologies to collect information, including cookies and web beacons.

Web beacons (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage and campaign effectiveness. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see Your Choices below.

Any aggregated information shared in this manner will not contain your Personal Information.

If you post information or content, such as by posting photos, commenting on a blog, or participating in online forums or communities, or when you interact with the Services through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, depending upon your privacy settings, this information may become public on the Internet. We cannot prevent further use of this information. You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. Please refer to those third-party sites’ privacy policies and terms of use to learn more about their privacy practices, which we do not control.


With Legal and Law Enforcement. We may share information collected about you with law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other 7-11 user to legal liability or if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;

5. Social Sharing Features:

The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.

This includes working with third parties such as ad networks which collect personal information via tracking technologies to serve personalized advertisements on and off our Services, provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement. To the extent we or our partners use such technologies on the Services, we offer an opt-out as discussed below in Section 9.
We do not knowingly sell or otherwise disclose the Personal Information of minors under 16.


Choices for Access, Deletion, Opt-Out of Sale, and Right to Non-Discrimination for California Residents or As Required by Law:

If you are a California resident, you have the right to know what personal information we collect, disclose, and “sell” about you (as that term is defined in the CCPA). Additionally, you have the right to access, delete and opt out from the “sale” of your personal information.
To exercise these privacy rights and choices, please follow the instructions below:

    How to Request Access to Personal Information: You may request access to your personal information twice in a 12-month period. To do so, please complete the webform in 7-Eleven Privacy Rights Portal, email us at privacypolicy@7-11.com or call 1-866-467-8688 (Service Code: 711). Account holders can request access to their personal information at any time by logging into their accounts on the Services. In response, we will produce an “Access Report” detailing the personal information we have collected, disclosed, and/or sold about you. This Access Report will be delivered by mail or electronically at your request.
    How to Request Deletion of Personal Information: You may request that 7-Eleven delete the personal information it has collected and/or maintained about you. To do so, please complete the webform in 7-Eleven’s Privacy Rights Portal, email us at privacypolicy@7-11.com, or call 1-866-467-8688 (Service Code: 711). Note, we may need to retain certain Personal Information as permitted by law, such as to complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a requested good or service, detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activities, comply with legal obligations or to enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations or lawful within the context in which you provided the information.
    How to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information: We offer an opt-out from the use of cookies and other tracking technologies in connection with our Services, which may in some cases constitute the sale of your personal information under the CCPA or other privacy laws. To opt-out of the sale of your personal information, please click Do Not Sell My Personal Information or fill out this webform at the 7-Eleven Privacy Rights Portal. This will cause information to cease to be added to any cookies or other tracking technologies that have been set on our Services or block them entirely. Please note that you will need to opt out again if you visit one of our Services from a different device or browser of if you clear your cookies.

Verification:
Please note, we will take steps to verify your identity before fulfilling any of the above requests. If you maintain an Account with us, we will verify your identity through existing authentication practices for the Account (e.g., login and password). If you are not a registered member, we will verify your identity by matching two or three data points that you provide with data points that we maintain and have determined to be reliable for the purposes of verification (e.g., browser or device ID or purchasing history).

Authorized Agents:
You can use an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf but we may require the agent to be registered with the California Secretary of State (for CA residents) and verify his/her identity or demonstrate that he or she has power of attorney in connection with a request for access or deletion.

Anti-Discrimination Right:
You have the right to be free from discrimination in product quality, goods or services if you choose to exercise your privacy rights under the CCPA.

Financial Incentives:
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA. They include the following:

    Periodic Contests or Sweepstakes. Each contest or sweepstake have their own terms and conditions that describe how an eligible consumer can opt-in as well as withdraw from the contest or sweepstake.
    Loyalty Program. Earn points for qualifying purchases at 7-Eleven. A member of the loyalty program can opt-in by creating a 7-Eleven account, and can withdraw at any time from this program by clicking the following link and supplying the appropriate information: https://www.7-eleven.com/ccpa


Do Not Track Signals:
7-Eleven does not respond to Do Not Track signals to the extent received from a web browser. Because there currently is not a universally accepted technological or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals as reflections of user choice, we do not respond to them at this time. Once such technology is created and has received applicable regulatory approval, we will consider (a) whether it is possible; and (b) if so how it can be incorporated within 7-Eleven’s environment in the future.


Shine the Light:
California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident, you may request this information once per calendar year by contacting us at privacypolicy@7-11.com.
