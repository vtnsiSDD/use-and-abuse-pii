Terms of Service
Effective Date: April 2, 2015; Last Updated: March 18, 2020

The Quizlet website and all its mobile versions ("Service") is a hosted service operated by Quizlet Inc. ("Quizlet"). Any use of the Service is subject to the following Terms and Conditions of Service ("Terms of Service" or "Terms"), as well as to Quizlet's Privacy Policy, Quizlet's Community Guidelines, and Quizlet's Honor Code, all of which are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. Your use of the Service will constitute your acceptance of these Terms of Service.

Eligibility. Use of the Service is void where prohibited. The Service is intended for users over the age of 13, but is open to all ages. For children age 13 or younger (or other age of consent where required by local law), Quizlet offers a restricted feature set and website experience that removes certain features. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that (a) all registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; and (c) your use of the Service does not violate any applicable law or regulation.
Your Quizlet Account and Data. If you create an account on the Service, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and data, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account. Accounts are for individual, not organizational, use by a single person only. You may not share your account with any other person. You must notify Quizlet immediately of any unauthorized uses of your data, your account or any other breaches of security. Quizlet will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. Quizlet may from time to time set storage limits for your data, or take any other measures it considers appropriate to manage the Service. Quizlet may also from time to time change its policies on offering commercial content or displaying advertising, and may do this without notice.
Upgraded Memberships. Users have the option to purchase additional features or functionality for their Quizlet account ("Upgraded Membership"). Upgraded Memberships may be purchased either by (i) paying a recurring subscription fee; or (ii) pre-payment giving you access for a specific time period ("Pre-Paid Period"). The terms stated below will govern your participation in these programs.
Pre-Paid Membership Term: Upgraded Memberships purchased for a Pre-Paid Period will automatically terminate at the end of the Pre-Paid Period.
Group Orders:A Group Order provides credits towards multiple, individual Pre-Paid Period Upgraded Memberships via a unique upgrade link. The number of upgrade credits will be specified in the Group Order. Purchasers of Group Orders are solely responsible for the distribution of upgrade credits. All upgrades are non-transferable and irrevocable once a credit has been redeemed by an individual user account. Individual accounts which use a Group Order upgrade credit are not associated with any school, business, entity, institution or any other centralized account and the purchaser of the Group Order has no right to or interest in any account to which an upgrade credit has been applied, except where the purchaser of the Group Order and the holder of the account to which an upgrade credit has been applied are the same individual.
Subscription Cancellation by You: If you have purchased a recurring Upgraded Membership subscription, you may end your Upgraded Membership at any time. When you choose to end your Upgraded Membership subscription, your subscription does not renew on the next auto-renewal date. You may continue to enjoy your Upgraded Membership benefits until that date, after which your account will be automatically downgraded. Information on how to end your subscription can be found here.
Cancellation by Us: We may cancel your Upgraded Membership at any time for any reason, with or without prior notice.
Refunds: Except where required by law, Upgraded Memberships purchased directly through Quizlet are non-refundable. Upgraded Memberships purchased through other platforms are subject to the refund policies of those platforms. Quizlet cannot be held responsible for these platforms' policies. We do not provide any refunds if the price for an Upgraded Membership drops, or if we offer subsequent promotional pricing or change the content or features of the Service.
Price changes: Quizlet may change the price for upgraded memberships from time to time. Quizlet will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Upgraded Memberships will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to maintain your Upgraded Membership after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Upgraded Membership prior to the price change going into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.
Premium Content.: Users may have the option to purchase or gain access to commercial content on Quizlet (“Premium Content”). Access to Premium Content may be granted either by (i) purchasing access directly on the Service (“Content Subscription”); or (ii) entering an access code (“Access Code”). The terms stated below will govern your participation in these programs.
Content Subscriptions: Access to Premium Content purchased as part of a Content Subscription is subject to the terms set forth during the purchase process and you are bound by the restrictions included.
Access Codes: Access to Premium Content through use of a publisher-provided Access Code is subject to the terms set forth by the publisher and you are bound by the publisher’s restrictions, including expiration of codes.
License: Once you have purchased a Content Subscription or used an Access Code to access Premium Content, you may access the included material for the designated period of time. You may access the Premium Content only for your own personal, educational use (“Personal Use”). Each account must purchase its own Content Subscription or enter its own Access Code, and accounts may not be shared by multiple users.
Restrictions: You may not use Premium Content for any commercial purpose. This means you can’t sell it, use it for advertising or marketing purposes, or use it in any other way in connection with a business or profit making activity. You may not post or otherwise make the Premium Content available on any website. You may not share, send, sell, sublicense, or transfer the Premium Content to someone else.
