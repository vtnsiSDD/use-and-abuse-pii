Each party shall be responsible for its costs incurred in such arbitration, but if you cannot afford to pay for the arbitration you agree to provide us the option of paying the arbitrator before seeking to initiate any other form of dispute resolution, including litigation.

15. Severability

These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of 7-Eleven. No waiver of any provision of these Terms will constitute a waiver of such provision in any prior, concurrent or subsequent circumstance, and 7-Eleven’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
Part Two – ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO THE 7REWARDS LOYALTY PROGRAM

If you have an Account and have properly recorded Points or Punches to your Account or converted your Points to Point Rewards or are eligible to receive a free Reward Product, there may be periods of time where your accumulated Points, Point Rewards, Punches, or Reward Products do not appear in your Account. Rest assured, such Points, Point Rewards, Punches, or Reward Products are still linked to your Account, and are available for conversion or redemption in accordance with these Program Terms once availability resumes.

3.2. Obtain and Redeem Point Rewards with your Points

You may obtain Point Rewards with your Points, which can be redeemed for certain items or for discounts on eligible items at the time of purchase at participating 7-Eleven stores in the U.S. We reserve the right to add or delete products and services eligible for redemption using Point Rewards at any time, at our sole discretion, without notice. We reserve the right to add or remove the availability of any dollar-denominated discount eligible for redemption using Points at any time, at our sole discretion, without notice. For further details of items you can obtain with your Point Rewards, please log into your Account and follow the prompts to view the list of available items. Points cannot be redeemed on purchases of the following products/services: fuel, age-restricted items (such as cigarettes, tobacco, lottery tickets and alcohol), financial services, prepaid card products, money orders, gift cards, phone cards, stamps, Post Office stamps and merchandise, event tickets, bus tickets and passes, charitable donations, gift with purchases or as may be excluded in a particular promotions, and any other items specified as exclusions from time to time (collectively, the “Excluded Items”). In order to obtain Point Rewards with your Points, follow the prompts in your Account to convert your Points into redeemable items or in-store at the register to convert your Points into discounts (each will be represented as a redeemable item in the “digital wallet” in your Account, “Point Rewards,” and together with Punch Rewards, collectively, “My Rewards”). When obtaining a Punch Reward with your Points, you must have enough Points to obtain the applicable Point Reward. POINT REWARDS MAY NOT BE USED TO OBTAIN EXCLUDED ITEMS. Once the Points you have accumulated are converted into Point Rewards, those Points will immediately be deducted from your Account, and cannot be credited back to your Account or converted into another Point Reward. You must use the same Account when converting Points to Point Rewards and cannot combine and convert Points accumulated in separate Accounts into Point Rewards.

3.3. Redeeming Punches

You may only redeem Punches for a free Reward Product at participating 7-Eleven stores in the U.S. You will qualify for one free Reward Product based upon the applicable number of Punches (as we may specify) you have properly recorded to your Account and/or 7Rewards Card. If you have created an Account and have properly linked and recorded the applicable number of Punches (as we may specify) to your Account, your Account will be updated so that you can scan to receive your free Reward Product. You must use the same Account when redeeming Punches and cannot combine Punches accumulated in separate Accounts to redeem your free Reward Product. At this time, Punches may not be redeemed in the 7-Eleven NOW App.

We are not responsible for any Points, Punches or My Rewards used by a third party using a lost or stolen 7Rewards Card, and if the lost or stolen 7Rewards Card is not linked to your Account we are not responsible for the use or loss of any of your Points and Punches. Should the security of your Account be compromised, including in the event your mobile phone or other electronic device capable of accessing your Account is lost, stolen or compromised, you should re-set your Account password immediately.

1. 7-Eleven NOW Services

7-Eleven wants to make the Products you love available to you in ways that are convenient to you. In furthering this mission, we created the 7-Eleven NOW application (the “7-Eleven NOW App”) and the 7-Eleven NOW website (the “7-Eleven NOW Website,” together with the 7-Eleven NOW App, collectively the “7-Eleven NOW Service”), which give users the capability to order Products for delivery. The 7-Eleven NOW Service is currently beta software, meaning that are still in development and may not function fully or may not function without error. During this test phase, delivery services are limited to participating locations. All Orders placed using the 7-Eleven NOW Service are subject to availability and your acceptance of these Terms.

2. Acceptance of Order

Your placement of an Order does not necessarily assure that we will accept your Order. We reserve the right to refuse any Order in our sole discretion for any reason, including but not limited to lack of availability, errors on the 7-Eleven NOW Service, and/or errors in the Order. Once a properly completed Order is received, authorization of your form of payment is received and we have accepted your Order, we will begin preparing your Order for pickup or delivery, as applicable, and will send you an Order Confirmation.

3. Guest Checkout

You must have a valid, active Account to use the 7-Eleven NOW Service. If you do not have an Account, you may create one at the time of your Order. Accounts are subject to the terms set forth in Part Two above.

4. Pricing and Availability

All prices are shown in U.S. dollars, and taxes, shipping and handling charges (if any) are additional.

FOR EXAMPLE, SOMETIMES 7-ELEVEN NOW SERVICE PRICES WILL BE HIGHER THAN IN-STORE IN IN-7REWARDS APP PRICES. We reserve the right to charge a “Small Basket Fee” if your Order does not exceed a minimum amount, which may vary by area. You will be advised of any applicable Small Basket Fee prior to checkout. At the present, you may not redeem rewards, coupons or other promotions offered as a part of the 7Rewards Program for Orders placed via the 7-Eleven NOW Service. All of our Products are subject to availability, and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any Order, to reject all or part of an Order, to discontinue offering certain Products and to substitute Products without prior notice. We strive to provide you with high-quality Products, and given the perishable nature of certain Products and market conditions beyond our control, we may be required to make substitutions from time to time. If you are not satisfied with a substitution, please contact us at 800-255-0711.

The delivery fee quoted at checkout may be different than the actual delivery fee for your Order. Differences may occur based on changing availability of drivers, changes in traffic, and other factors between the time your submit your Order and the time your Order is dispatched for delivery and are determined solely by our third party delivery partners. You agree to pay any such differences in delivery fee and that 7-Eleven is under no obligation to inform you of such changes before charging your payment method for the actual delivery fee.

5. Payment and Billing Information

By providing a credit card or other payment method that we accept, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated payment method and that you authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the total amount of your purchase (including any applicable taxes and other charges) (collectively, an “Order”). If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, your Order may be cancelled. You must resolve any payment method problems before we proceed with your Order. If you want to delete your payment method or add a new payment method, you can do so at any time by accessing your “wallet” within the 7-Eleven NOW Service.

In some cases, we (or our third party payment processor) may authorize or reserve a charge on your payment method. The authorization is not a charge. However, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount. In the event that the amount of our authorization exceeds the total funds on deposit in your payment account, you may be subject to overdraft or non-sufficient funds charges by the bank issuing your payment method. We are not responsible for these charges and are unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank.

When checking out within the 7-Eleven NOW Service, you may choose to store your credit / debit card information for future use. This information will not be stored by 7-Eleven but by our payment processor, Stripe. This information will only be used to pay for purchases through the 7-Eleven NOW Service when you choose to use the stored card.

6. Points for Purchases

Purchases made through the 7-Eleven NOW Service are not eligible to earn or accumulate 7Rewards Points. From time-to-time, we may, in our discretion, award promotional points in association with purchases made through the 7-Eleven NOW Service but are under no obligation to do so.

7. Deliveries

Once you place your Order, you will be provided with an estimated delivery time at checkout. This time is only an estimate and your actual delivery time may be longer or shorter depending on a variety of factors including, among others, traffic, distance, availability of delivery agents at any given time, and weather. You are responsible for inspecting all Products you receive from us for any damage or other issues upon delivery. 7-Eleven reserves the right to charge you the full Order amount if you or your designated recipient is not at the designated delivery location when the delivery agent arrives to complete the delivery as well as a restocking or return fee. For deliveries containing alcohol or other age-restricted products, see Section 11 below for additional requirements. You acknowledge that transportation or logistics services are provided by third party independent contractors who are not employed by 7-Eleven.

9. Taxes

We will collect applicable sales tax on Products shipped in the states for which we determine we have a duty to collect sales tax. If a Product is subject to sales tax, you agree that the amount of taxes shown at checkout may be adjusted. Several factors may cause this, such as variances between processor programs and changes in tax rates.

10. Product Information Disclosures

While we work to ensure that Product information is correct, on occasion manufacturers may alter their ingredient lists. Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and/or different information than that shown via the 7-Eleven NOW Service, at a 7-Eleven store, or in an Order confirmation. For these reasons you should not rely on the information presented, but should always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a Product.

2. Loading Value to Your Card

The Card is reloadable. In the United States, you can load value to your Card by visiting any participating 7-Eleven store. You may load value to your Card using a debit card, a credit card, cash (at participating 7-Eleven stores), Apple Pay or Google Pay.
