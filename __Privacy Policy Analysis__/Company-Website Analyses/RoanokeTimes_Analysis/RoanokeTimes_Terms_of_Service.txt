Auto-Renewal, Cancellation, and Refund Policy
EZ Pay is a convenient electronic payment method that automatically renews your Digital Only or news subscription service (your “subscription”). If you register for EZ Pay or debit banking (ACH) payments, your subscription will continue unless you contact our customer care center to cancel your subscription. On the last day of your current term (your “Renewal Date”), your plan will automatically renew for the same term unless you choose to cancel more than twenty-one (21) days before your Renewal Date (your “Cancellation Date”).
IF YOU DO NOT AFFIRMATIVELY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE YOUR CANCELLATION DATE, YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR AN ADDITIONAL TERM FOR THE PLAN YOU INITIALLY SELECTED AT THE RATES IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL. YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME BY CALLING 800-346-1234.
If you have provided us with a valid credit card number or an alternate payment method saved in your account and you have not cancelled by your Cancellation Date, your subscription will be automatically processed up to fourteen (14) days in advance of your Renewal Date and the payment method you provided to us at or after the time of your initial subscription purchase will be charged.
We reserve the right to change your subscription rate at the next renewal period. If you are not satisfied with your subscription rate or service, you may cancel your subscription at any time. The full amount of any balance over $5.00 will be returned. We do not provide refunds prorated for the remainder of the payment period for Digital Only subscriptions
There is a one-time account set up fee of $6.99 for all new subscribers. Subscribers who prefer to receive paper renewal notices in the mail will be charged $4.99 each renewal notice – this fee is waived for subscribers who sign up to receive their renewal notices via email. If you wish to receive renewal notices via email, please contact us using the contact information found at roanoke.com/contact.
