YOU AGREE THAT YOU, AND NOT JIMMY JOHN'S, SHALL ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE JIMMY JOHN'S PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF ONE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($100.00) FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS.

Indemnification
YOU AGREE TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD THE JIMMY JOHN'S PARTIES HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DAMAGES, COSTS, AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO (I) YOUR USE OF THIS WEBSITE OR ANY PRODUCTS OBTAINED THROUGH THIS WEBSITE AND/OR (II) YOUR BREACH OF ANY OF THE TERMS OR CONDITIONS CONTAINED HEREIN.

Term and Termination
Jimmy John's shall have the right to terminate your access to, and use of, the Website and to block or prevent future access to and use of the Website and to delete your account and any related information immediately, if, in its sole discretion, Jimmy John's believes that your conduct fails to conform with these Terms & Conditions. Jimmy John's also reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of these Terms & Conditions, including without limitation any violation arising from any submission, posting, or e-mails you make or send to the Website. Upon termination of these Terms & Conditions, all rights granted to you under these Terms & Conditions will cease immediately, and you agree that you will: (a) immediately discontinue use of the Website(s); and (b) as applicable, pay any amounts owed to Jimmy John's in full within thirty (30) days from the date of such termination.

Applicable Laws
These Terms & Conditions shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to conflicts of laws principles.

Arbitration
Agreement to Arbitrate All Disputes. Except as it relates to qualifying small claims and injunctive relief as explained below, you agree that any and all disputes, controversies, or claims arising between you and Jimmy John's (each a "Claim" and collectively "Claims"), including but not limited Claims arising out of or relating to the Site, use of the Site, these Terms and/or the Privacy Policy, shall be settled by binding and final arbitration in accordance with the then prevailing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS ("JAMS Rules and Procedures"). The JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at https://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling (800) 352-5267. The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator, who shall be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator's decision, judgment, or award in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. The arbitrator shall apply Georgia law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor all claims of privilege recognized at law. For the avoidance of doubt, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the arbitrability of any Claims, the scope, applicability, interpretation, and enforcement of this arbitration agreement, and the interpretation, applicability, enforcement, formation of these Terms and/or the Privacy Policy.

Small Claims and Injunctive Relief. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from pursuing qualifying small claims in small claims court. If your Claims qualify for small claims court, you may still assert your Claims in small claims court so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. In addition, you and Jimmy John's both retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional or injunctive relief, including for pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.

Class Waiver. You may not act as a class representative or private attorney general or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the Claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.

Arbitration Costs and Procedures. If you initiate arbitration against us, you will not be responsible for professional fees for the arbitrator's services or any other JAMS fees. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be cost-prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Jimmy John's will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate. Pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures, the arbitration shall proceed in a location determined by the arbitrator (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties.

Enforcement and Invalidity. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither claimant nor Jimmy John's shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.

THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE JAMS RULES AND PROCEDURES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR JIMMY JOHN'S WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.

Commencement of Actions
ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THIS WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE-YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES.

Miscellaneous
The failure of Jimmy John's to act with respect to a breach of these Terms & Conditions by you or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit Jimmy John's rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify these Terms & Conditions. Jimmy John's may assign its rights and duties hereunder to any party at any time without any notice to you. These Terms & Conditions may not be assigned by you without Jimmy John's prior written consent. If any provision of these Terms & Conditions shall be unlawful, invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms & Conditions and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. These Terms & Conditions may not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties.

Forward-Looking Statements
These Terms & Conditions and the documents incorporated by reference herein, if any, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements are based on management's current expectations and assessments of risks and uncertainties and reflect various assumptions concerning anticipated results, which may or may not prove to be correct. Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in such forward-looking statements include the pattern of brand sales, including variations in sales volume within periods; competition within the relevant product markets, including the ability to develop and successfully introduce new products, ensuring product quality, pricing, promotional activities, introduction of competing products, and continuing customer acceptance of existing products; loss of distributorship rights; risks inherent in acquisitions and strategic alliances; the loss of one or more key employees; the effects of a prolonged United States or global economic downturn or recession; changes in costs, including changes in labor costs, raw material prices, or advertising and marketing expenses; the costs and effects of unanticipated legal or administrative proceedings; and variations in political, economic, or other factors such as currency exchange rates, inflation rates, tax changes, legal and regulatory changes, or other external factors over which Jimmy John's has no control. Jimmy John's has no obligation to update any forward-looking statement in these Terms & Conditions or any other document incorporated herein.

JIMMY STORE TERMS & CONDITIONS
General
By shopping at the Jimmy Store, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by these Jimmy Store Terms & Conditions, in addition to the General Terms & Conditions. These Jimmy Store Terms & Conditions apply to all offers, agreements, and transactions that are made or entered into in connection with the sale and delivery of products from the Jimmy Store.

These Jimmy Store Terms & Conditions are to supplement the General Terms & Conditions listed above, in addition to supplementing the Jimmy John's Privacy Policy, and all other policies posted on www.jimmyjohns.com or any of its sub-pages, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Since these incorporated policies will also be applicable to your visit to the Jimmy Store, please review all policies prior to placing an order.

To the extent these Jimmy Store Terms & Conditions are inconsistent or incompatible with the General Terms & Conditions listed above, these Jimmy Store Terms & Conditions will supersede and prevail with respect to your use of the Jimmy Store.

Account Registration
A registered account is not required in order to shop at the Jimmy Store. To make online shopping faster and easier, however, you may choose to register for an account with Jimmy John's Franchisor SPV, LLC. Please confirm your email address when creating your account, as we will use the email address on file to contact you with any issues concerning your order. If you do not wish to set up a registered account, you may still shop and purchase as a "Guest." Whether you create a registered account or complete your purchase as a Guest, you agree to provide honest, accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep your information updated and accurate.

Online Availability
Jimmy John's strives to have the latest and greatest styles available for purchase in every size. If the style or size you want is not listed, it is not available. Although the Jimmy Store is designed to feature "real-time" inventory levels so that only in-stock items are visible and available for purchase, we may experience shortages of stock in a particular style or size, and cannot guarantee that items which appear to be in stock are actually available. All items are subject to availability and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any order, to reject all or part of an order, and to discontinue products without notice, even if you have already placed your order. If the item you would like to purchase is currently out of stock, we apologize for the inconvenience and encourage you to call our customer service line at 866.276.6302, so that we may help you find a similar product.

Ordering and Changes to Orders
When you place an order we will send a confirmation email to the address that you have provided. If you are using your workplace email address, please be aware that many companies use spam filters to disqualify incoming automated emails, which could impede the delivery of our confirmation email to you or send it to junk mail.

The "Confirmation" page sets out the final details of your order. After you have reviewed the Confirmation page and opted to proceed with your order, we will send you an order acknowledgement email detailing the products that you have ordered. Please note that this email does not serve as either an order confirmation or order acceptance from Jimmy John's.

Acceptance of your order and the completion of the agreement between you and Jimmy John's Franchisor SPV, LLC for your order will occur upon our dispatch to you of the products ordered, unless we have notified you that we do not accept your order or you have cancelled it. Jimmy John's reserves the right to accept or decline your order for any reason up until the time the product is actually delivered to you. Jimmy John's reserves the right to limit or prohibit orders that Jimmy John's believes, in its sole discretion, may be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors.

Due to the short timeframe between order and shipment, it is difficult to make changes once your order has been placed. If you contact our customer service team before shipping arrangements have been initiated, however, we will do our best to facilitate a change.

Tax
Where applicable, sales tax will be assessed on each order at the applicable local rate. You agree that taxes may be adjusted from the amount shown on the payment screens. You are solely responsible for any and all duties, taxes, levies, or fees (including any sales, use, or withholding taxes) imposed on or in connection with purchases from the Website by any authority.

Payment
Personal checks, money orders, and cash payments are not acceptable forms of payment at the Jimmy Store. We may require credit cards and debit cards to be issued by an institution in the jurisdiction in which you are located, and those forms of payment must be linked to a billing address in the same jurisdiction. For most jurisdictions, you must ensure that the billing address associated with the credit- or debit-card issuing bank is the same billing address that you enter when ordering. Jimmy John's reserves the right to supplement the list of acceptable forms of payment at the Jimmy Store.

Because Jimmy John's Franchisor SPV, LLC does not charge for items until they ship, we may use a pre-authorization process to reserve your products for shipment. In order to avoid unnecessary overdraft charges, a method called a "pre-authorization" is often used by banks to verify that the credit/debit card in use is valid and has sufficient funds. Most authorizations expire within five to seven days, but the issuing bank ultimately determines the length of the authorization. The final credit- or debit-card charge will only reflect the value of your shipped merchandise plus applicable shipping and taxes.

If you are experiencing problems with payment, please contact our customer service line at 866.276.6302, and a member of our team will be happy to assist you.

Delivery and Shipping
All orders are shipped via the United States Postal Service ("USPS"). You may select any USPS shipping option, and delivery times will vary based on the option selected. Expedited shipping options are available at check-out for an additional charge. Merchandise can only be shipped within the United States.

Our goal is to process and ship your order within 3 to 4 business days after receipt of the order. This is an estimate only, however, and shipping dates are not guaranteed.

Except as stated below, orders are shipped Monday through Friday during regular business hours (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time). Orders selected for next-day shipping that are received before 1:00 p.m. Central Time will ship the same day. Orders received after that time will ship the following day. Orders for which next-day shipping is selected that are received before 1:00 p.m. Central Time on a Friday will be delivered on the following Monday. Orders received on a weekend day or an observed holiday will be processed on the next business day. Orders will not ship on the following days:

January 1
Martin Luther King Day
Memorial Day
July 4
Labor Day
Thanksgiving Day
Day After Thanksgiving
December 24-26
December 31

Upon shipment of your order, a tracking number will be emailed to the address that you have provided. This tracking number will allow you to check on the delivery status of your order through www.usps.com.

We strive to ship all items in an order together, but we reserve the right to deliver your products in separate shipments if one or more items are unavailable at the time of initial shipment. In the event that we split your order into more than one shipment, you will not be charged separate shipping costs for each shipment. Further, each shipment will have a confirmation/tracking email. If we experience an issue fulfilling one part of your order, that will not serve as a basis for canceling any of the other items included in that order.

Cancellations, Exchanges, and Refunds
ALL SALES ARE FINAL. EXCHANGES AND REFUNDS WILL NOT BE PERMITTED. Prior to fulfillment of an order, however, you may cancel your order by contacting our customer service team at 866.276.6302. Once an order has been fulfilled, the order will be deemed to be completed, and Jimmy John's will no longer be able to cancel the order or offer a refund.

Risk of Loss
All items purchased at the Jimmy Store are made pursuant to a shipment contract with USPS. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon tender of the item(s) to the carrier.

Product Descriptions and Pricing
The Jimmy Store aims to be as accurate as possible. Jimmy John's Franchisor SPV, LLC makes no warranty, however, that product descriptions, colors, photographs, videos or other product related content on the Jimmy Store are wholly accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. Jimmy John's cannot guarantee that your computer or device's display of color or other product features is accurate.

Despite our best efforts, a small number of items may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by Jimmy John's is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. The prices displayed on the Jimmy Store are quoted in United States Dollars.

Changes
Please note that, subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to change the goods advertised or offered for sale through the Jimmy Store, the prices or specifications of any such goods and any promotional offers and any content available at the Jimmy Store at any time and from time to time without any notice or liability to you or any other person.

FREAKY FAST REWARDS® TERMS & CONDITIONS
GENERAL
Freaky Fast Rewards® is operated by Jimmy John's Franchisor SPV, LLC (together with its affiliates, "Jimmy John's"). By accessing or participating in the Jimmy John's Freaky Fast Rewards® program ("Freaky Fast Rewards®"), you acknowledge and agree to be bound by these Freaky Fast Rewards® Terms & Conditions (the "Rewards Terms"), in addition to the General Terms & Conditions listed above. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE REWARDS TERMS DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE FREAKY FAST REWARDS® PROGRAM. These Rewards Terms are a supplement to the General Terms & Conditions listed above, in addition to supplementing the Jimmy John's Privacy Policy, and all other policies posted on www.jimmyjohns.com or any of its sub-pages, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. To the extent these Rewards Terms are inconsistent or incompatible with the General Terms & Conditions listed above, these Rewards Terms will supersede and prevail with respect to your use of Freaky Fast Rewards®.

ELIGIBILITY
Freaky Fast Rewards® is open to legal residents of the 50 United States of America and the city of Washington, D.C., provided, however, that Jimmy John's may, in its sole discretion and for purposes of conducting "beta testing" or otherwise offering a test phase, limit enrollments using geolocation technologies in order to restrict enrollment to specific markets. Freaky Fast Rewards® is intended for personal use only. Commercial use is prohibited. Freaky Fast Rewards® is not targeted toward, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 13. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may only participate in Freaky Fast Rewards® under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Rewards Terms.

HOW FREAKY FAST REWARDS® WORKS
Freaky Fast Rewards® participants ("participants" or "Frequent Freakers™") earn Freaky Fast Rewards® benefits, or "Rewards," based on the number of qualifying orders placed at participating Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches restaurants. Redemption of Rewards is subject to availability, and Rewards may not be redeemed in combination with other promotions, special offers, discounts or coupons. Qualifying orders begin earning Rewards upon the first presentation of a digital Freaky Fast Rewards® account at the time of a qualifying order on or after March 15th, 2019.

HOW TO ENROLL
If you already have an active Jimmy John's account, you can join Freaky Fast Rewards® by clicking "Log In" to add rewards to your account in the Rewards section of the Jimmy John's mobile app, or by visiting online.jimmyjohns.com/rewards

If you do not have an active Jimmy John's account, you can create a Jimmy John's account and join Freaky Fast Rewards® by clicking "Sign Me Up" in the Rewards section of the Jimmy John's mobile app, by visiting online.jimmyjohns.com/rewards, or by visiting any participating Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches location.

Registration may require you to provide your first name, last name, date of birth, email address, phone number, username, password, and marketing preferences. The use of this information will be governed by Jimmy John's Privacy Policy.

EARNING, TRACKING, & REDEEMING REWARDS
No Rewards may be earned until you enroll in Freaky Fast Rewards®. To earn Rewards for a qualifying order, provide the phone number linked to your Jimmy John's account at the point of sale when placing a qualifying order in a Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches restaurant or over the phone, or log in to your Jimmy John's account before placing a qualifying order on www.jimmyjohns.com or using the Jimmy John's mobile app. Qualifying orders must be paid for with cash, a valid debit or credit card, a valid Jimmy John's gift card, a valid Apple Pay or Google Wallet account; or by redeeming a Reward; however, purchases using other currency or promotional offers are not qualifying orders.

Rewards are issued by Jimmy John's on a periodic basis and may not be identified to you in advance. Jimmy John's has the sole discretion to determine the Rewards, including if and when the Rewards will be issued. Rewards are subject to change or substitution without notice. Number, type and frequency of Rewards are based upon several factors, including, without limitation, the frequency of orders, the volume and type of purchases made, and Freaky Fast Rewards® usage. An otherwise qualifying order placed less than two hours after a previous order will not be eligible to earn Rewards. Multiple menu items purchased in a single order may count as no more than one qualifying order for purposes of earning Rewards. Some exclusions apply; purchases of Jimmy John's gift cards, purchases on the JJ Store at store.jimmyjohns.com, taxes, tips, fees, purchases made using Group Ordering, and purchases with a dollar value less than $3.00 are not qualifying orders and do not earn Rewards. If you cancel a qualifying order, such order will not be considered for purposes of earning any Reward. Orders made through third-party delivery platforms (e.g. Doordash, Grubhub, UberEats, etc.) may not qualify as purchases toward member status or receipt of Rewards. These purchases are also not eligible to receive Rewards as a missed transaction request.

Frequent Freakers™ can view and track qualifying orders and available Rewards by logging into your Jimmy John's account at online.jimmyjohns.com/rewards or via the Jimmy John's mobile app, or by providing the phone number associated with your Jimmy John's account when visiting or calling a participating Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches location.

Redeem any available Reward at participating Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches restaurants when logged into your Jimmy John's account on www.jimmyjohns.com or in the Jimmy John's mobile app, by providing your Freaky Fast Rewards® Pass when visiting a participating Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches restaurant, or by providing the phone number associated with your Jimmy John's account when visiting or calling a participating Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches restaurant. Multiple Rewards may not be redeemed in a single order. Rewards expire if not used by the expiration date assigned to them. Redemption of Rewards is subject to availability of the selected Rewards at the time of redemption. Partial Rewards will not be issued. If the entire value of a Reward is not used when redeemed, the remaining balance will be forfeited, no remaining balance will be refunded nor will any remaining balance be available for application toward future orders. The Rewards are not gift certificates. Rewards are promotional and have no cash value. Rewards may not be exchanged for cash, any cash equivalent or any other products, or combined with other discounts or coupons. Jimmy John's has no responsibility to retroactively apply Rewards or use of the Freaky Fast Rewards® program.

SPECIAL OFFERS
In addition to Rewards, Jimmy John's may from time to time in its sole discretion make available to Frequent Freakers™ the ability to earn additional Rewards through special challenges or other promotions, or to earn other prizes or program benefits. The terms and conditions applicable to any such Rewards, challenges, promotions, prizes or benefits will be determined by Jimmy John's in its sole discretion and communicated to participants in conjunction with any such offers. Because any terms and conditions associated with any special offers under Freaky Fast Rewards® may be different from or in addition to provisions of these Reward Terms, you should read any such special offer terms and conditions carefully before participating in any special offer.

LIMITATIONS, RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER TERMS
You have no ownership interest in any Rewards. Your Freaky Fast Rewards® account and any accumulated Rewards are personal to you and may not be sold, transferred or assigned to, or shared with, family, friends or others, or used by you for any commercial purpose. You may have only one Freaky Fast Rewards® account.

Jimmy John's determinations of participant eligibility or any questions or disputes arising under the Freaky Fast Rewards® Program, these Rewards Terms or any other Jimmy John's Rewards program rules or restrictions shall be final and binding and not subject to challenge or appeal. Nothing in these Rewards Terms will limit Jimmy John's from exercising any rights or remedies it may have hereunder, at law, or in equity.

Without notice to you, Jimmy John's reserves the right to suspend or terminate any Freaky Fast Rewards® account and/or your participation in Freaky Fast Rewards® if Jimmy John's determines in its sole discretion that you have violated these Rewards Terms, you have more than one (1) Freaky Fast Rewards® account, or that the use of your Freaky Fast Rewards® account is unauthorized, deceptive, fraudulent, unlawful, or intentionally subverts the purposes of these Rewards Terms. Jimmy John's may, in its sole discretion, suspend, cancel or combine accounts that appear to be duplicative. In the event that your account or your participation in Freaky Fast Rewards® is terminated, then all accumulated Rewards in your account are void and will be deemed forfeited. You are responsible for all activity on your Freaky Fast Rewards® account.

Without notice to you, Jimmy John's reserves the right to terminate or suspend your Freaky Fast Rewards® account in the event that your account is inactive for more than one year.

There are no membership fees associated with Freaky Fast Rewards®, although use of online services in conjunction with participation in Freaky Fast Rewards® programs may result in data charges, internet access fees or similar expenses.

Jimmy John's is not responsible for any problems or technical malfunction of any telephone network or lines, computer online systems, servers, or providers, computer equipment, software, failure of any e-mail as a result of technical problems or traffic congestion on the Internet or at any website, or any combination thereof, including, without limitation, any resulting error in computing qualifying orders or any unavailability of Rewards, or any injury or damage to any participant's or any other person's computer or mobile device related to or resulting from participation in Freaky Fast Rewards®. If, for any reason, the Freaky Fast Rewards® program is not capable of running as planned, including due to errors of any kind or nature, infection by computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention, fraud, technical failures, or any other causes beyond the control of Jimmy John's which corrupt or affect the administration, security, fairness, integrity or proper conduct of any Freaky Fast Rewards® program, Jimmy John's reserves the right in its sole discretion to cancel, terminate, modify, or suspend the Freaky Fast Rewards® program or otherwise respond to the circumstances as Jimmy John's deems appropriate.

CHANGES TO FREAKY FAST REWARDS®
Jimmy John's reserves the right to change, update and/or discontinue, in whole or in part, Freaky Fast Rewards® or any portion of the program, all or any portion of these Rewards Terms, and/or any policy, FAQ, guidelines or disclosures pertaining to Freaky Fast Rewards®, at any time in its sole discretion and without advance notice to you or any other participants. Unless otherwise specified, any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions to our terms, and you waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications. Such changes may affect previously accumulated Rewards. If we change or modify the Rewards Terms, we will revise the "last updated" date located at the top of these Rewards Terms. Your participation in Freaky Fast Rewards® confirms your acceptance of these Rewards Terms and any such changes or modifications; therefore, you should review these Rewards Terms and applicable policies and FAQs frequently to understand the terms and conditions that apply to Freaky Fast Rewards®. If you do not agree to the revised Rewards Terms, you must stop participating in Freaky Fast Rewards®.
