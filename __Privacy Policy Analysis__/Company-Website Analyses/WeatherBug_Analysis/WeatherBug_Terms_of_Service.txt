INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. You acknowledge that any breach, threatened or actual, of this Agreement, including, without limitation, violations or infringement of WeatherBug's intellectual property or proprietary rights, may cause irreparable injury to WeatherBug, whereby such injury would not be quantifiable in monetary damages, and WeatherBug would not have an adequate remedy at law. In the event of such injury or potential for such injury you therefore hereby agree that WeatherBug shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or actual, of your obligations under any provision of this Agreement.

GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement has been made in and will be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York as applied to agreements entered into and completely performed in the State of New York.

WAIVER & SEVERABILITY. WeatherBug's failure to insist upon strict performance of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement by you will not operate as a waiver of any subsequent default or failure of performance. If any part of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law or court order including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and the liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision(s) that most clearly matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in effect.
