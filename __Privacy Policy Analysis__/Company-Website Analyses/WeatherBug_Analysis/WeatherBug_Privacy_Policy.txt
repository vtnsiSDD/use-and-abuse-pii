Effective Date: February 16, 2021

This policy discloses the privacy practices of WeatherBug properties (referred to as "we," "us," "our," "WeatherBug"). These include the website https://www.weatherbug.com, and the WeatherBug desktop and mobile applications (collectively, "the Services"). This privacy policy describes how WeatherBug collects, uses, shares, and secures the personal information you provide. It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use, access and correction of your personal information. WeatherBug is a division of xAd, Inc. dba GroundTruth ("GroundTruth"). To learn more about GroundTruth and its privacy practices, please visit https://www.groundtruth.com/privacy-policy.

WeatherBug's Privacy Policy, below, describes the types of personal data WeatherBug collects, the types of third parties to which it discloses personal data, and the purposes for which it does so. Residents of the European Economic Area ("EEA") have additional rights regarding access to, rectification or erasure of, restriction of processing, and portability with respect to the personal information that WeatherBug maintains. To exercise these rights, contact us at privacy@weatherbug.com. For information on opting out of interest-based advertising delivered on WeatherBug Services, please see the Digital Advertising & Your Choices section of this Policy below.


Information Collection
We collect the following types of information:

Personal information refers to information that identifies specifically who you are, such as your name, e-mail address, or mailing address. We may also ask you for demographic information or other information such as ZIP Code, gender, date of birth and your interests. In many cases we need this information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that you have requested. You may provide us with this personal information if you register with WeatherBug, for a personalized service, submit pictures, video or other user generated content, or participate in a promotion or sweepstakes. We or our affiliates may also derive physical address information and infer other general or precise location-related information from the information collected from mobile devices, such as the stores and other places the device frequents, or usage information for differentiating and/or associating multiple device users as well as associating devices or users with locations such as a household or workplace.

Usage information refers to information that we collect about browsers, wireless networks and devices that access our Services. For instance, we may collect information about how many users come to our Services, what types of browsers and devices accessed the Services, IP address, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site, device platform ad ID, date and time of visit, web viewing and app use data, wireless network performance, usage and identifiers, and precise location data. We may use cookies, web beacons, a device identifier, and other similar technology to collect this type of usage data. For more information, please see the "Tracking Technologies" section below. This data may be collected from our desktop properties or mobile apps even when you are not actively using the app.

We may also collect data from certain third parties and combine that data with information we collect as described above or derive through analytical techniques, including combining personal and usage information together.

Location Information
When you have installed or use a WeatherBug service, such as one of our mobile applications, we may collect information about your device's precise location, including your location relative to and within third party merchant locations (in-store beacons). We may also collect data from cellular towers or WiFi networks near a device to infer the location of a device. Our affiliates including GroundTruth may also share location related-information with us. We may collect or receive location-related information even if you are not logged into or using the application.

We use location information to operate and enhance our service as well as customize the content, weather alerts, and advertising we provide to you. We may also share location information with our affiliates including GroundTruth to enable product features and for advertising and reporting purposes. Visit the Digital Advertising & Your Choices section to learn how to control the collection and use of location information.

Tracking Technologies
WeatherBug and our partners, affiliates, analytics, or service providers use cookies, beacons, tags, scripts, device identifiers, or similar technologies to analyze trends and use of our Services, administer the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on a user-level and aggregated basis. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our Website or service. To manage Flash cookies, please click here. To learn more about the use of such data collected through these technologies, visit the Digital Advertising & Your Choices section.

Use of Information
We may use the information we collect or derive through analytical techniques for a variety of purposes, including:
Operating, maintaining, customizing, and improving our Services;
Responding to your requests and questions;
Providing personalized weather information;
Delivering advertising we believe to be relevant to your interests, both about our products and the products of other third parties - for instance, we may use the location related data to present ads from a local business or use that and other data we collect to deliver ads that you may find more relevant;
Performing analytics, research, and attribution, including predicting possible relationships among different browsers and devices;
Monitoring the Services for compliance with the law and our terms of service;
For product development; and
Any other purpose disclosed at the time of collection.
Information Sharing
We may share information we collect or derive through analytical techniques with third parties for a variety of purposes, including:
With our affiliates and with other divisions of GroundTruth for their own use;
With service providers that help provide the Services pursuant to our instructions, such as ad serving;
With third parties for their own direct marketing or targeted advertising purposes;
With wireless service providers and other third parties who use it to analyse consumer mobile trends and improve wireless networks;
For analytics and research purposes;
As part of a corporate sale, merger, or acquisition, or other transfer of all or part of our assets including at bankruptcy;
In response to a court order, warrant, subpoena, or other legal process, or as otherwise required by law or to meet national security requirements, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the rights of third parties, investigate fraud, or respond to government request; or
With your consent.
Also, when you share information through our Services, such as photos or videos, some information about you may be made available to the public. If you would like us to remove your post from the page or application, contact us at privacy@weatherbug.com.

Digital Advertising & Your Choices
We may partner with GroundTruth and with various third parties that engage in interest-based advertising ("IBA"). This type of advertising involves the collection of web viewing, location-related information and mobile application use data from our Services and other non-affiliated websites and mobile applications over time and across associated devices. This data is used to infer interests and deliver relevant advertising back to a browser or device, and to browsers and devices that are associated with each other. Browser Choice: For more information about IBA, and to learn how you can exercise choice regarding the practice on your browser for companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") WebChoices tool, you can visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices or TrustArc (click here).
App Choice: You may also download an application on your iOS or Android device in order to exercise choice regarding the collection of mobile application use activity for IBA on this device by companies that participate in those choice tools. Links to those applications are below:
DAA AppChoices iOS
DAA AppChoices Android
TRUSTe mobile app iOS
TRUSTe mobile app Android

Location Data Choice: The DAA's AppChoices tool can also be used to exercise choice regarding the collection and use of precise location data by GroundTruth for IBA purposes. To limit the collection of precise location data by other parties through our application for a particular device, you can turn location services off through your device's settings.

Note that electing to opt out from IBA will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or device, erase cookies from your browser, or reset your platform ad identifier, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. In addition, companies may still collect data in browsers or apps for non-IBA purposes such as for analytics and reporting purposes, operations, improving our or their Services, and frequency capping.

WeatherBug Mobile Application
When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier.

We may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device for example the operating system type or user identification information.

We use mobile analytics to allow us to better understand the functionality of our application on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.

We use Google Analytics to better understand how visitors interact with our Websites. This service provides usage information including but not limited to data on where visitors came from, what actions they took on our Sites, and where visitors went when they left our Sites. We use this information to improve your experience when visiting our Website. Please click here to learn more about this service and how to opt out of data collection by Google Analytics.
